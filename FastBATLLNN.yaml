description: >
  FastBATLLNN is a fast verifier of box-like (hyper-rectangle) output 
  properties for Two-Level Lattice (TLL) Neural Networks (NN). FastBATLLNN 
  uses both the unique semantics of the TLL architecture and the decoupled 
  nature of box-like output constraints to provide a fast, polynomial-time 
  verification algorithm: that is, polynomial-time in the number of neurons 
  in the TLL NN to be verified (for a fixed input dimension). FastBATLLNN 
  fundamentally works by converting the TLL verification problem into a region 
  enumeration problem for a hyperplane arrangement (the arrangement is jointly 
  derived from the TLL NN and the verification property). However, as 
  FastBATLLNN leverages the unique properties of TLL NNs and box-like output 
  constraints, its use is necessarily limited to verification problems 
  formulated in those terms. Hence, FastBATLLNN can only compete on the 
  tllverifybench benchmark.
